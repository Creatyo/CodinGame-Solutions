## Introduction
In this reposority you will find my working solutions for puzzles on the platform https://www.codingame.com/.
My solutions are not the best possible case, but they work.

Just one tip : try to do a bit more harder beffor search for the solution, it will be more efficient for your learning of programmation.
But if you don't find a answer, you are welcome.
More than that, if you have a better solution, help me and modify my code, it can make me progress and valid your knowledge.

In the table below you can see which puzzles I already completed for each categories :  easy, medium and hard.
